    <strong>What is HTML?</strong>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.<br>It is the standard language used to create and design web pages on the internet. <br>It was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 at CERN as a simple markup language.<br> Since then, it has evolved through versions from HTML 2.0 to HTML5 (the latest 2024 version).<br>
         <hr><em>HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language.<br>Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and Markup language defines the text document within the tag.</em></p>
